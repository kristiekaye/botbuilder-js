# ![Bot Framework SDK v4 for JavaScript](./docs/media/BotFrameworkJavaScript_header.png)

This repository contains code for the JavaScript version of the [Microsoft Bot Framework SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-sdk), which is part of the Microsoft Bot Framework - a comprehensive framework for building enterprise-grade conversational AI experiences. 

This SDK enables developers to model conversation and build sophisticated bot applications using JavaScript. SDKs for [.NET](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet), [Python](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-python) and [Java (preview)](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-java) are also available.

To get started building bots using the SDK, see the [Azure Bot Service Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).  If you are an existing user, then you can also [find out what's new with Bot Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/what-is-new?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

## Getting Started
To get started building bots using the SDK, see the [Azure Bot Service Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

The [Bot Framework Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-samples) includes a rich set of samples repository.

If you want to debug an issue, would like to [contribute](#contributing), or understand how the Bot Builder SDK works, instructions for building and testing the SDK are below.

### Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/)
- [Nyc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc)
- [Mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Your favorite code-editor for example [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Clone
Clone a copy of the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js.git
```

Change to the SDK's directory:

```bash
cd botbuilder-js
```

### Build and test locally
Install the prerequisites. This will also run the postinstall script (`lerna bootstrap --hoist`).

```bash
npm install
```

Then use the following command to build the SDK.

```bash
npm run build
```

### Running unit tests

Use the following command to run the unit tests.

```bash
npm run test
```

The `prep-test.cmd` command is run to install test keys and start the [Azure Storage Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-emulator) if its installed. Any unit tests needing test keys or the storage emulator are designed to be skipped if their dependencies are missing so most developers won't need to worry about running this command. 

If you have a need to re-generate the LUIS or connector clients using the latest swagger you'll need to install `autorest` (requires Node 7.10.0 or higher), which you can do with the following command.

```bash
npm install --global autorest
```
